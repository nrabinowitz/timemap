If you are using timemap.js and appreciate the work that went into it, please consider making a donation to support the project. I'll treat donations as incentives to add features, clean up remaining issues, and write more documentation.

If you prefer, you could also make a donation as a [Kiva.org gift certificate](http://www.kiva.org/app.php?page=gift&action=giftPromotion) for public (at) nickrabinowitz (dot) com.

Thanks for your support!
