CHANGELOG (somewhat rough - see the SVN commit log for more detail)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5
-----------
- Fairly substantial changes to the loader architecture - should make everything a
little cleaner, and allows implementation of service-specific loaders (e.g.
Flickr, etc). IMPORTANT: Loader files have moved to the loaders/ directory.
- Some changes to TimeMap.init() syntax - the only things not backwards-compatible
are the preloadFunction and transformFunction params, which should now go in an
options object within the dataset object.
- Added loader for JSON strings

Version 1.4
-----------
- Added support, tests, and one example for Timeline v.2.2.0
- Added local optimized copy of Timeline v.1.2
- Added GeoRSS parser (points only)
- Moved KML parser to separate file. NOTE: You now need to load kmlparser.js
separately to load KML, unless you are using timemap_full.pack.js.
- Improvements to default date parser
- Added several new examples: Google spreadsheet, lines between points, polytween
- New tests and small bugfixes

Version 1.3
-----------
- Relicensing with the MIT license
- some code refactoring - IMPORTANT: I removed timemapinit.js and made the init()
function a static method on TimeMap. The timemapInit() function still works (I
aliased it) but is deprecated. I also moved all post-initialization manipulation
functions to their own file, manipulation.js.
- adding json2 library and functions for exporting TimeMaps
- first release of experimental editing UI (jQuery-dependent)
- better filter chain handling
- tweaks and bugfixes

Version 1.2
-----------
- tweaks and bugfixes
- code cleanup
- a few new features, notably support for image overlays
- several new hooks for custom functions

Version 1.1
-----------
- tweaks and bugfixes
- added timemapInit() function

Version 1.0
-----------
- first release of the core library
